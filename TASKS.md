**Note**: This task list is based on the comprehensive QA analysis performed on the current codebase. Priority levels may be adjusted based on project requirements and timeline constraints.

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-05  
**Review Frequency**: Weekly during active development

## ORIGINAL TASK HISTORY (Reference)

> **Note**: Previous development completed structural foundation with excellent architecture and RFC framework understanding. However, core functionality remains as stubs requiring implementation for production readiness.

### **Completed Foundation Work**
- ✅ **Protocol Structure Design** - DTLSPlaintext/DTLSCiphertext structures
- ✅ **Message Framework** - Handshake messages and state machine design  
- ✅ **Architecture Patterns** - Provider factory, Result<T> error handling
- ✅ **SystemC Integration** - TLM model design and framework
- ✅ **Test Infrastructure** - Comprehensive test framework structure

### **Key Achievement**: Excellent Foundation
The existing codebase demonstrates outstanding RFC 9147 understanding and architectural design. The structural foundation provides an excellent base for completing the production implementation.
