# Hybrid PQC Regression Test Integration

## Summary

The hybrid Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) implementation following draft-kwiatkowski-tls-ecdhe-mlkem-03 has been **successfully integrated** into the DTLS v1.3 regression test framework. This integration ensures that hybrid PQC functionality is automatically tested for regressions alongside all other DTLS v1.3 features.

## Integration Overview

### ✅ Complete Test Coverage

The hybrid PQC tests are integrated across **all test categories**:

1. **Unit Tests** (`dtls_crypto_test`)
   - `crypto/test_hybrid_pqc_mlkem_operations.cpp` - ML-KEM operations testing
   - `crypto/test_hybrid_pqc_key_exchange.cpp` - Hybrid key exchange testing
   - `crypto/test_hybrid_pqc_compliance.cpp` - Specification compliance
   - `crypto/test_hybrid_pqc_test_vectors.cpp` - Reference test vectors

2. **Performance Tests** (`dtls_performance_test`)
   - `performance/test_hybrid_pqc_performance.cpp` - Performance benchmarking vs classical ECDHE

3. **Security Tests** (`dtls_security_test`)  
   - `security/test_hybrid_pqc_security.cpp` - Security validation and attack resistance

4. **Interoperability Tests** (`dtls_interop_test`)
   - `interoperability/test_hybrid_pqc_interop.cpp` - Cross-provider compatibility

### ✅ Regression Framework Integration

The hybrid PQC tests are **fully integrated** into the existing regression testing infrastructure:

#### Performance Regression Testing
```bash
# Run performance regression testing (includes hybrid PQC benchmarks)
make run_performance_regression

# This executes dtls_performance_test --regression which includes:
# - ML-KEM vs ECDHE performance comparison
# - Hybrid key exchange latency analysis  
# - Memory usage regression detection
# - Throughput impact assessment
```

#### Baseline Management
- Hybrid PQC performance metrics are automatically recorded in `performance_baseline.json`
- Regression detection compares current hybrid PQC performance against historical baselines
- Alerts are generated for performance degradations in PQC operations

#### Continuous Integration
All hybrid PQC tests run as part of:
```bash
make run_all_tests              # Includes all hybrid PQC test categories
make test_report                # Comprehensive reporting including PQC results
make test_coverage              # Code coverage includes hybrid PQC implementation
```

## Regression Test Execution

### Standard Test Execution
```bash
# Individual test categories
make dtls_crypto_test           # Hybrid PQC unit tests
make dtls_performance_test      # Hybrid PQC performance analysis 
make dtls_security_test         # Hybrid PQC security validation
make dtls_interop_test          # Hybrid PQC cross-provider testing

# Comprehensive test suite (includes all hybrid PQC tests)
make run_all_tests
```

### Performance Regression Analysis
```bash
# Full performance regression testing
make run_performance_regression

# PRD compliance validation (includes hybrid PQC requirements)
make run_prd_validation

# Performance benchmarking with hybrid PQC metrics
make run_performance_benchmarks
```

### Automated Reporting
The regression framework generates comprehensive reports including:
- `performance_regression_report.txt` - Text-based regression analysis
- `performance_regression_report.json` - Machine-readable regression data
- Security validation reports with hybrid PQC attack resistance metrics
- Cross-provider interoperability reports
