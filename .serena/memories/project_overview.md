# DTLS v1.3 Implementation Project Overview

## Purpose
A comprehensive implementation of DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) version 1.3 protocol following RFC 9147 specifications. The project provides both C++ and SystemC implementations for production use and hardware/software co-design verification.

## Features
- Full RFC 9147 compliance
- Modern security with AEAD encryption and perfect forward secrecy
- Thread-safe concurrent connection support
- Connection ID support for NAT traversal
- Pluggable crypto providers (OpenSSL, Botan, hardware acceleration)
- High performance: <5% overhead compared to plain UDP
- Scalability: >10,000 concurrent connections

## Current Status
Based on git history, the project has completed:
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (Week 1-3)
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Cryptographic Implementation (Week 4-5)  
- ‚úÖ Phase 3: Core Protocol Implementation (Week 6-7)
- üöß Currently in Phase 4: SystemC Modeling (Week 8-12)
- ‚è≥ Pending: Phase 5: Integration & Testing (Week 10-14)

## Architecture
The implementation is structured around:
- Core protocol layer (`src/protocol/`)
- Cryptographic providers (`src/crypto/`)
- Memory management system (`src/memory/`)
- Core types and utilities (`src/core/`)
- Public API headers (`include/dtls/`)

## Development Phase
Currently in development with core protocol implementation complete. The handshake message layer and record layer security have been implemented. Next phase involves SystemC modeling and comprehensive testing.
